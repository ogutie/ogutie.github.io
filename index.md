## Favorite CPSC 120 Labs

*Lab 6, Part 1
  This was my most favorite lab due to the reason that it had my favorite practices.This being std vector and if statements. Plus this part of the lab made me really hungry and was awesome.

*Lab 7
  This is my second favorite lab because the feel of actually making a parking system really challenged my skills. This was also great because this time the lab wasn’t so long and was only one part. But yet I did have problems with the amount of long code I had to write.

*Lab 8, Part 1
  This lab was my third favorite lab because during this lab I was personally feeling the best. This lab was also great because of the use of for loops. The loops at time to me were mysterious to me and with this lab I got a better understanding of the for and while loops.
